- title: Cracking the Coding Interview
  author: Gayle Laakmann McDowell
  summary: \"Very in depth book about coding interview at big tech companies. It provides advice on the interview process but also helps you train on classic coding interview problems. It's great to read the different interview questions chapters while doing some online coding problems on Leetcode or a website alike. There is a lot to read though so you might want to focus on specific chapters where you know you are lacking.\"
