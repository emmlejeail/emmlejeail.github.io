  intro: >
    Dynamic and motivated software engineer, with 4+ years of experience in backend software engineer and data engineering.
    Passionate about distributed systems and machine learning. I like to build things for fun (and sometimes break them).
    My ideal workday is one where I get out of my comfort zone to learn about a new technical skill.
    I am your out-going type of engineer, that likes giving presentations and working with a team.
