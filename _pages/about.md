<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emmanuelle, I live in France (Paris area) and I'm a Software Engineer! I got into computer science during my high-school years and never really looked back. I've did a first internship in a really awsome startup called The Things Network in the Netherlands, that really got me into playing with connected devices. Then I moved on to a larger company working in the travel industry called Amadeus where I was doing a lot of data engineering and playing with machine learning models. I joined Datadog in 2022 to work on their application security product, an area that I was really unfamiliar with at first but that I've really grown to love.</p>
<p>I love digging into anything AI, distributed system, playing with raspberry pis, or participating to hackathons. In this blog I hope to share some useful bits & tricks of my tech side projects.</p>
<p>When I am not writting posts here, you can find me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ManuLejeail"><img src="{{ baseurl }}/../../assets/images/twitter.png" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/emmanuelle.lejeail"><img src="{{ baseurl }}/../../assets/images/linkedin.png" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></a> or <a href="https://www.github.com/emmlejeail"><img src="{{ baseurl }}/../../assets/images/github.png" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></a></p>
<p>Are you wondering why this blog is called <b>ramen bytes</b>? It's simply my favorite food ever since I fell in love with Japanese cuisine.</p>
